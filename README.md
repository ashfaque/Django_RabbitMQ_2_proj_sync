# Django_RabbitMQ_2_proj_sync
A demo project to demonstrate the real time sync of data between two django rest framework projects running independently on different servers isolated with each other.

### To demonstrate this, user will be created, updated, deactivated/reactivated in project [drf_signal_simplejwt](https://github.com/ashfaque/drf_signal_simplejwt) and it will be auto reflected in this project.
